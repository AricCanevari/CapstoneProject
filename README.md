# CapstoneProject

Goal:
Create a messaging Client/Server architecture that is secured using encryption.

	- Manage user accounts
		-Users Cridentials

Parts done:

Client Server exchange
Client to Client Messaging

Parts to work on:

user to server encryption, usercreation/ServerKey database, connection reversal/session hijacking(allowing connections through nat)
